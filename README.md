# Why This Project?
**1. To Learn Typescript**<br/>
I have been learning Typescript syntax. This project was for getting my foot in the door of Typescript and digest the input knowledge by doing a toy project.

**2. To Implement three states toggle button**<br/>
I want to know how to build toggle buttons and understand how they work under the hood.
